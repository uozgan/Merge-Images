# Merge Cat Images

This project consist of a code challange to implement a program to merge images into a single one by
using Node JS.

As part of the development process I did:

- Fixed inconsistents in the existing code to make it work.
- Replace the deprecated packages with up to date ones.
- Refactor the code to make it more modern and scalable by seperating the concerns and spliting the
  logic into utiliy functions.
- Documented the code for clear understanding.
- Treated the exceptions to guarantee that the program will run with consistency.
- Improved the folder structure.
